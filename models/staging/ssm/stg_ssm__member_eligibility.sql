Use this model for:
  - Fields have been renamed and recast in a consistent way.ยน
  - Data types, such as timezones, are consistent.
  - Light cleansing, such as replacing empty string with NULL values, has occurred.
  - If useful, flattening of objects might have occurred.
  - There is a primary key that is both unique and not null (and tested).
